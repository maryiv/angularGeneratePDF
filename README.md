# Angular 5 DEMO

This project was developed using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

JIT compilation is the default when you run the build-only `ng build` or the build-and-serve-locally `ng serve` CLI commands.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

For AOT compilation, append the `--aot` flags to the build-only or the build-and-serve-locally CLI commands:
`ng build --aot` and `ng serve --aot`. The `--prod` meta-flag compiles with AOT by default.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
